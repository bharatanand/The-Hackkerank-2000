Some C++ data types, their format specifiers, and their most common bit widths are as follows:

    Int ("%d"): 32 Bit integer
    Long ("%ld"): 64 bit integer
    Char ("%c"): Character type
    Float ("%f"): 32 bit real value
    Double ("%lf"): 64 bit real value

Input Format
Input consists of the following space-separated values: int, long, char, float, and double, respectively.

Output Format
Print each element on a new line in the same order it was received as input. Note that the floating point value should be correct up to 3 decimal places and the double to 9 decimal places.

Sample Input Format
